## <span class="icon_color">⏳</span> Who am I
I am currently graduated in Systems Analysis and Software Development.
My skills involve a wide knowledge of high and low level systems programming.
As experience I have worked with scientific research in artificial intelligence and robotics, web development, reverse engineering and software security.
My experience includes advanced knowledge of high level programming languages, as well as low level systems, and languages for Web Services, Web servers, Web deployment and more.
I love testing the limits of software, as well as programming low-level systems and finding new ways to make things work.
I enjoy working in environments that challenge me and give me new opportunities to challenge my brain.
